A Joshful Song from movie Sam Bahadur  #IndianArmy
Watch sambahadur. Its a better movie.  PS: I have watched both the movies.
"Sam Bahadur review.   It’s a well made good boy movie. Great research, good ensemble cast, it doesn’t put a feet wrong. The right dialogues, well written subplots. It starts on the same note, as It ends. Like a Good boy.   Is it blockbuster material? I guess not. It’s a disciplined biopic. An illustrious CV brought to life. “The adventures of Sam Maneckshaw” like Sherlock Holmes, with a distinct mannerism, solving cases in an episodic manner. Makes for a great binge watch.   But it isn’t like a Border with a build up towards a crescendo. That’s my only quibble. Could have had a rousing 1971 climax. It stays one note.   Also, Vicky kaushal is great. But sometimes when you are imitating a particular style of someone, your entire effort goes there and sometimes it limits your acting range. But he pack enough punch. That’s his versatility. Any other actor would have looked like a caricature.   Also, the movie sings no bhajans for Nehru, treats him like any other politician 😊 Do watch."

"People going gaga over a film like animal is just so problematic. A movie like Sam bahadur which is made on a very inspiring real life hero is being ignored n a movie lyk animal is being celebrated. No wonder, toxicity n violence has become new normal in our society. 😢😢"
Sam bahadur also a good movie you watched it ?
"Mr. Perfectionist for a reason.  No story line, pathetic dialogues, poor direction and content and this movie earns more than the real hero Sam bahadur. Where are we heading to?? #AnimalTheMovie"
"Enjoyed watching #SamBahadur #VickyKaushal once again proved his excellence in acting. His portrayal of General #SamManekshaw ... his gait, his get up, his style... everything looked so perfect! @vickykaushal09 thank you @meghnagulzar for making this movie. ज़रूर देखें अगर अभी तक नहीं देखी."
"@meghnagulzar #SamBahadur #SamManekshaw Meghana ji just watched Sam Bahadur today. I really appreciate your efforts in making this film,a well made movie. Especially as a veteran I could relate and enjoy every bit of it. Well done to you and your team. However few suggestions.1/4"
Loved the movie SamBahadur. Very inspirational and inspired me to be more disciplined and consistent. Amazing with done by Vicky Kaushal.
"PVR me lgi #Sambahadur ke sthan pr aapne ek 18+ rated #Animal ko dekhna chuna or ab shikayat kr rhe ho ki movie me vulgar language thi, sex tha🤔"
#SamBahadur also comes late in the day when the genre of films based on war heroes has seen an overkill with @RSVPMovies itself making movies in the similar genre like #Pippa & #Tejas In fact a whole sequence from #Pippa also features in #SamBahadur offering little novelty value
Sam Bahadur is a movie which everyone should Watch. Vicky Kaushal Ticked all the boxes. The emotion was real.  #SamBahadur
"Don’t take it seriously. Most of the people who go to theatre want masala and entertainment. I am sure everyone who will watch Sam Bahadur will realise that it’s a better movie. But for bollywood, it’s all about raking money and one simple funda, any publicity is a good publicity"

"In Bangalore, It’s disappointing to see only 20 people in a theatre on first day release of #SamBahadur and theatre was houseful for #Animal which is an average movie.   Please go to theatres and watch an amazing movie #SamBahadur . #VickyKaushal you have done a brilliant acting."
"#SamBahadur If not for the very few scenes between the family & the climax war song, this movie almost felt like a docu film. Vicky Kaushal as FM Sam Manekshaw is brilliant. He lived in the character. Liked the scenes where he fights with his officials with words the most."

It’s simple if a man from middle class family earning 20k CAN afford only one movie in month obviously big cast big hype animal and Sam Bahadur is ott material anyway MOVIE  EARNS from audience like me not those poor  or rich will watch many so only 2 big moviesshould be released

"In today's day and age, Sam Bahadur would have been sued on Me Too.... for calling a man or a woman 'Sweety'. What a fine movie. Vicky has done absolute justice to the great man.   #sambahadur @vickykaushal09 @meghnagulzar"
"Watched SamBahadur today. Well made movie minus the melodrama. Vicky Kaushal has fleshed out FM Manekshaw very well including the looks and the mannerisms, the walk. He looks every inch FM Manekshaw. The movie is made up of a series of anecdotes that most of us"

What a waste of time @_PVRCinemas Movie time of Sam Bahadur was 8:00 PM and it's already 8:30 and we are watching unnecessary advertisements from the last 30 minutes. Location DLF Mall Noida.
It's Movie🍿🎥🎥🎥 For Entertainment😎🎭🎭  Not any Books📚 To Study  Movie always Has Different types of Viewers  Some person would Love❤ Sam Bahadur Some person would Love❤ Animal   It's Their own Choice  Who are You Or Who am I To Tell Them  What is Right Or Wrong❌
"@vickykaushal09 🫡  Do watch the movie #SamBahadur    It's not that typical documentary film, it has those moments of comic scenes  So those who might think we can't handle a documentary kinda thing  ,it is not   @meghnagulzar 🙌"
Ekdum feeki chai si insipid movie hai Sam Bahadur  All Vicky Kaushsl has done is perfect the stopped stance & stare of Sam Maneckshaw. The movie is all about showing Vicky in that stance from various angles. Bas ......
We give holidays to schools to attend cricket matches. Why dont we do the same for schools to watch a wonderful movie that espouses patriotism and valour. Key ingredients to ingrain are next generation. #sambahadur #VickyKaushal
Sam bahadur is sub standard false narrative movie

Go watch Sam Bahadur in cinemas now as well very important movie
Much much better movie than nonsense Animal.  But sadly the state of society is such that Sam Bahadur is not even 50 75 crs whereas the trash movie without any logic or sensitivity is at 250 crs @GabbbarSingh
"Sam Bahadur one of the most iconic movie no kissing scenes,no s*x scenes pure cinema.. #SamBahadur when people choose their cinema it shows their mentality and things they crave for ."
"Beyond the movie, the essential import of the phenomenon of ‘#SamBahadur’ is so much more than just that of the hero of the 1971 Indo-Pak War | India's first Field Marshal | @vickykaushal09 | https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/sam-bahadur-1503247193.html"

Went to watch Sam Bahadur today instead of Animal coz I personally couldn't see that much of violence. Although Couldn't relate much with the movie coz of so many army related concepts but there's no doubt that Vicky Kaushal's acting has nailed it.  #SamBahadur #weekend
"Sam Bahadur is not a movie its documentary of there is no war, no dialogs, no goosebumps moment like Uri or Udham sigh, no supporting actor in powerful shaded.    only Vicky acting .... tell me extly what you like in Sam Bahadur?    we audince know.....@2 >"
You should have been smart enough not to go to the movie. Instead you should have watched Sam bahadur and gave us update.
"Ms Gulzar, who made Sam Bahadur, is spreading the blatant falsehood that Manekshaw walked with a stoop to justify a lanky non actor's role in her movie, who has a wooden expression. And does not march smartly. B'Wood  spends crores to malign the Army! @sanjoychakra @DLNarayan2"

Even SamBahadur is also doing well. But uska hype nahi na so.  But movie is very good.

Indian govt disrespected #SamBahadur on his death and now Indians avoid a movie dedicated to his life. No state support like in the past for other productions.

"Go for Sam Bahadur instead, good n decent movies need more appreciation and then the society cries bollywood is spoiling culture, society promoting obscenity etc etc"
Ekta LOMer movie banieche.. Kal few of us friends went to see it.  Was not endurable right from the word GO. First half dekhei we quit the place and went for Sam Bahadur in a nearby theatre. ❤
was thinking of watching Sam Bahadur as the movie looked good and it's got good WOM but I just found it's not even showing here 🥲... seems like it's got a very limited release outside India and all the other showtimes have been taken by other movies  OTT it is I guess🥲

The clash is not worth mentioning bcz sam bahadur had no buzz it is not like salaar and dunki clash and the duration doesn't matter becoz it's one of the selling pt with it being A rated kyuki it's getting similar no of shows doesn't actually matter nd A rated me sab dekh rahe ha

Your right but what can be done. They are money paying audiences they have all the rights which movie they want to watch. If #SamBahadur did not clash with animal then it would have got much appreciation if the movie was good.
% of man and kid getting influenced by movies is higher in India. Director himself who got mentally disturbed by critic reviews decided to add more violence n do a movie like Animal. Fact that ppl chose Animal over Sam Bahadur is biggest influence. Men attract -ve than +ve films
Watched #SamBahadur. Brilliant movie. What a performance by @vickykaushal09 sir. Feels goosebumps throughout the movie. @meghnagulzar ma’am direction is on another level. Proud to be an Indian🇮🇳
Why Indian journalists promote such nonsense movies like #Animal but not a wonderful movie like #SamBahadur ???? I mean come on… sooo disappointed and disgusted 🤢. @taran_adarsh @kamaalrkhan @KomalNahta
Feels like Sam bahadur and 12th fail are the only good movies produced by Bollywood this year

"Sam bahadur is a good watch. No faltu drama,no forced  jokes n all.Good movie based on  legendary person. And vicky kaushal nailed it as a #SamBahadur"
I watched Sam bahadur yesterday .. no doubt the acting is superb but I found the movie very slow. The actuality couldn't justify the excitement with which I went to watch the movie.
Watched the movie SAM BAHADUR... Excellent movie nice adaptation of Sam by vicky. Well chalta hai bloody good movie... SWEETY...
What. A. Movie.  #SamBahadur
Friday night conversation  Wife: Let's watch Animal this weekend? Me: Only front row seats are available.  Wife: Next weekend dekhte hain fir.  Last night (after watching some reviews and clips) Wife: Ye to badi bekar movie lag rahi hai. Koi aur option nahi hai? Me: Sam Bahadur
"if men actually wanted to see an alpha male character, they'd see a movie like Sam Bahadur, a movie made on an actual hero for our country but they are idolizing a champu. faltu mein bewakoof gunde ki tarah maarna, auraton ko harasses and objectify karna, chee. na-mard kahin ke"
Precisely! I am glad to see that the proportion of people getting inspired from the likes of Sam Bahadur is increasing. We need more movies like this!!!
Has any state government declared #SamBahadur tax free? The movie should be a must-watch in all schools across the country.
"It’s a Fricking movie everyone, not to get inspired or change like that.  By seeing Sam Bahadur not everybody have become Sam By seeing Badlapur not everybody started having their vengeance…. So chill, just watch and leave it…."

Animal is a pathetic C grade film. A certificate is not enough. The whole movie should have been banned. Horrible movie. What do they want to convey through the movie? Rather go and watch Sam Bahadur and get to know one of our real heroes. Terrific performance by @vickykaushal09
@RonnieScrewvala @meghnagulzar  What a Great Personality was Sam Bahadur. Hats off to Vicky Kaushal who literally created a real life SamBahadur.  The Movie & Vicky deserve an Oscar
"Even if you keep the misogyny aside, it was a terrible movie. Can’t wait to watch Sam Bahadur, I’ve heard great things!"

@RonnieScrewvala @meghnagulzar   Salute to You on producing an Outstanding Movie Sam Bahadur. Vicky Kaushal Presented Sam Bahadur as I have seen him. He used to often visit Bombay House the Tata Group Headquarters & Ronnie your office was at Nanavati Mahalaya.
I don't understand people's taste.. Gore and violent movies like Animal are hit while the realistic and inspirational movies like Sam bahadur earns less.... Even the excellent and true story based movie like Mission Raniganj was a flop...Why?
"Sam Bahadur dekhne gya tha, 20 min ke baad jo neend aayi hai movie khatam hone ke baad utha"
Sam Bahadur is a good movie
#SamBahadur gathered momentum towards evening shows on Day 1… Biz needs to multiply on Sat-Sun for a respectable weekend total… Fri ₹ 6.25 cr. #India biz.

"We don’t need to say much about Sam himself, but this portrayal is one of the best I have seen in quite some time. The movie may or may not get box-office, but this is the closest I can get to being a “fan” of someone. #SamBahadur #VickyKaushal #MeghnaGulzar"
Haven't seen Sam Bahadur yet so can't comment but I have been waiting for a film on the Armed Forces which gets even close to this Gem ♥️  Guess This Movie.
"As a non-political, middle class movie goer except for #VickyKaushal #SamBahadur has nothing for me. 1. Weak characters. Nearly all looked distressed. 2. Poor BGM, songs.  3. Storytelling was pieces of documentary stitched together. Just like 83, watch YouTube interview. Ur done."
"#SamBahadur is steady on on the crucial Monday… Performing best at select metros mainly… Fri 6.25 cr, Sat 9 cr, Sun 10.30 cr, Mon 3.50 cr. Total: ₹ 29.05 cr. #India biz."
"Animal & Sam Bahadur releasing together today.   Some people will get to watch an Alpha Male, a Macho Man, the definition of how a real man should be & others will see Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s movie."
"Another problem in the movie SamBahadur is the portrayal of Indira Gandhi and acting by Sana Fatima. It almost feels like she is a bechari and except the meeting with US High Commissioner, doesn't leave a PM like impression."
And? That is their democratic right. Sam Bahadur movie is made by same people. How many made a movie on sam earlier? If you don't like a movie made by them don't watch why come up with such dumb arguments.
Sam Bahadur is amazing watch but I think the subject matter is so large that you can't summarize in just movie. It would have been better to make this in a series format as sometimes you can feel that pacing of movie is off. You can't enjoy one outcome but is already on next one
Animal can touch 450-500cr within 10 days.  Big feat.  All India collection.  Coupled with Sam bahadur.  500-550cr collection for box office.  Huge.  Increasing capacities.  More movie releases.  Expanding Indian language eco system.  Triggers for Film Exhibition Industry.
#AnimalTheMovie #SamBahadur 12k shows | 16%+ occupancy advance booking/collection 12 vs 69Cr #BoxOffice are sustains #weekdays #tamil #movies struggle with #CycloneMichaung and usual  lack of #Audiences
SAM BAHADUR : a must see  Makes Indians Proud Hope the cinema and govt extends monetary benefits to draw audience to the movie  #Bharat @majorgauravarya
Sam Bahadur was my ideal. I have written in my book about  his short sharp address to us before the 1971 Indo Pak War. I have not seen the movie but I do hope it has done justice to this charismatic & great leader.
#AnimalBoxOffice and #SamBahadur.  2movies over 2 days that's more than the last 6 months. Good month for the movies. Indian films have impressed
Not interested in animal movie..will definitely go for Sam bahadur..

"Watched #SamBahadur yesterday.  I feel this would be the best ever performance by @vickykaushal09  That accent, that body posture, face expressions! Brilliant!!!  Loved the movie!  @meghnagulzar"
"I have seen those three movies  Mission raniganj and 12th fail were good but their promotional team lacked the charm, where as SAM BAHADUR was an mediocre movie, where Actors like Vick kaushal potential was wasted nothing else."
"And about other movies, I have seen all of the kovies, Mission raniganj and 12th fail were awesome, but promotion team lacked their work,  Sam bahadur was a mediocre movie with a wasted potential of Vicky kaushal and other actors."
L rated movie hai sambahadur sayad 💀
awful background score...the unneccessary emphasis through Dham dhish dhissh...this is something that annoys me about all Indian movies. Certain places can you use silence like Sam Bahadur could have also. Sometimes expression is enough. But the rest was just fab!
what about the global worldwide collections of Sambahadur? this movie is best work of #VickyKaushal and #MeghnaGulzar hope people go and see this beautiful movie 🙌🏻
"Watched #SamBahadur last night, well made movie, kudos to @meghnagulzar, @sanyamalhotra07 @vickykaushal09. Will 10/10, even though movie had few minor flaws."
Watching Sam Bahadur for the second time tonight! For the love of the movie and brilliance of Vicky Kaushal #VickyKaushal #SamBahadur
Indian Army Chief General #ManojPandey joined the trailer launch of actor #VickyKaushal's upcoming movie 'Sam Bahadur' in #Delhi.  (07.11)  #TheRealTalkin
#SamBahadur Stellar performance by @vickykaushal09 . Awesome movie. Must watch.
Sam Bahadur deserved much more business than Animal but people's taste in movies these days 😮‍💨 toxic is the new cool.
Today I saw Sam Bahadur the movie based on the life of India's first Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw. I would like to praise the whole team of #sambahadur @vickykaushal09 @sanyamalhotra07 @fattysanashaikh Tremendous job done guys.

"I recently watched a Sam Bahadur patriotic movie that left me truly inspired. The narrative was gripping, weaving together elements of courage, sacrifice, and national pride seamlessly. The characters were well-developed, and the storyline kept me engaged from start to finish."
I Watched both movie #SamBahadur and #Animal.....But in Both movie #SamBahadur is 1000 times better than #AnimalTheMovie... #VickyKaushal You are gem man....Isko bolte hai acting Jai Hind🇮🇳🇮🇳👌👌 @vickykaushal09
"Review of the movie “SAM BAHADUR”  6/10 MOVIE.  NOT REALLY WORTH THE HYPE, TOO FAST PACED.  I DON'T KNOW WHY ITS GOT SO MANY GOOD REVIEWS. ITS A MOVIE THAT YOU CAN'T MISS A SCENE OF, OR YOU'LL BE CONFUSED AS THE WHAT'S HAPPENING."
"It will be long standing movie opposed to animal. Come OTT, sam bahadur would be more watched imo"
Overall just an okayish one time watch.  You will not be able to sit through it for 2nd time.  Really not understanding how this movie is doing that blockbuster business at box office. Acting alone doesn't make a movie great.   SamBahadur will be better than animal.
"Watched Sam बहादुर .  What a personality , what a guy , what a gentleman . Everytime i watch such a movie it's gives me sense of pride of being a Army brat and reminds of this countries brave men who fought for us. #SamBahadur #SamBahadurReview"
"@Mohanlal sir, you being a Lt. Col, why is Sam Bahadur not screening in your Haripad theatre? Such movies should reach the public."
Box Office: Animal and Sam Bahadur First Tuesday Early Estimates  #AnimalTheMovie | #SamBahadur https://www.sacnilk.com/news/Box_Office_Animal_and_Sam_Bahadur_First_Tuesday_Early_Estimates
Sam Bahadur is a biopic kind of movie and there is no creativity and performances which based on biopic or historical characters. Animal has a different script and the storyline & the way Ranbir Kapoor played his character is exceptional. He Brilliantly act in this movie 2 Good
"#Animal on any other time would have taken priority for watching in theatres, but not when #SamBahadur and #12thFail are running.   Anyone who doesn't watch the latter in theatres but have watched former, cannot complain why #Bollywood doesn't make much good movies."
"Better to watch sam bahadur ,nationalistic movie instead of this"
Golden moment for cinema goerd Watched Animal with the boys  Will watch Sam Bahadur with family  And will watch Wonka/Priscilla with cutie  Pura mahina movie dekhne jaunga 😎
"sam bahadur is a firmly written movie, the movie tries to follow the Hollywood-esque biopic path. The portrayal of Sam Manekshaw by Vicky Kaushal is commendable. The film lacks a strong and gripping climax. But I am a sucker for political dramas, so was hooked to it throughout"
Vicky Kaushal's performance gave me goosebumps in the entire movie. #SamBahadur is a masterpiece and every Indian should watch this and feel proud of the great soldiers that India has produced!!!
Guys why tf are you comparing #SamBahadur and #Animal  One is biography of the highest ranked individual of Army and other is pure fictional based movie made for entertainment.  Why can’t we as audience appreciate both wherever they lie? Both are absolutely good!
"Sam Bahadur is a brilliant Documentary movie: sans any emotional turbulence, or edge of seat climax or even poignant enough to force tears and thats precisely why it wont be hit. A great OTT product though."
#AnimalPark It's a very unfortunate that young generation of India is following such non-sense movies instead of praising good movies like #SamBahadur @vickykaushal09
"With all the hype and commentary going on around Animal, people are missing out on a gem of a movie that is Sam Bahadur."
Sam Bahadur must watch and support the genuine effort and take pride in greatest icon of our Indian Army… It’s a freaking disgrace that in this country a movie like ANIMAL makes 200crs in 3 days a gem like Sam Bahadur doesn’t even come close to it. @RSVPMovies
Choose your Movie ?  1) #Animal 2) #SamBahadur   Comment
"finally feeling great that movie abt real heroes are getting acknowledged, 4-5 days late but its there. ANIMAL can be good but SAM BAHADUR gives you something that u can bring back home. ✌️"
"#SamBahadur film is a biopic on our First Field Marshal  Therefore I humbly request @PMOIndia @nsitharamanoffc @rajnathsingh to make this film ""Tax Free"" throughout India  Kids, teenagers, young, old all sorts of PPL need to watch this movie for inspiration & love 4 nation"
Yehin toh maar khaa jaate hain sab..  jis movie ko promote karna chahiye usko hum chhod dete hain.. aur jisko nahin usko dekh lete hain.. kyun Bhai.. Sam Bahadur ko bhi toh Box Office collection chahiye. I will watch that too it in theatre.
Vicky Kaushal will surely win a National Award for his God level performance in Sam Bahadur Movie.Brilliant Portrayal.#SamBahadur
SAM BAHADUR   This movie is not only to watch & enjoy  but also to inculcate the values & the attitude Sir Manekshaw possessed.🙌🏻  Highly recommended for TEENAGERS. 🇮🇳
Nope. 1971 is a major part of the movie but never takes the centre stage. This is the beauty of the movie. Sam bahadur is always at the centre.
"Koffee With Karan 8: Karan Johar Reveals Shah Rukh Khan’s High Praise For Vicky Kaushal’s Performance in Dunki; Sam Bahadur Star Says, “I got to know why he is the Baadshah” https://hollynews.online/koffee-with-karan-8-karan-johar-reveals-shah-rukh-khans-high-praise-for-vicky-kaushals-performance-in-dunki-sam-bahadur-star-says-i-got-to-know-why-he-is-the-baadshah"
Guyzzzzzz Animal vs Sam bahadur Konsi movie dekh aayun ?
Exams over today alhamdulillah 🤞  😭 and Watching 3 Movies tomorrow.  Animal 2nd time Napoleon  Sam bahadur😔
Sam bahadur has to be the best Bollywood movie I've seen in a while
Watched #SamBahadur . Moments from #FieldMarshalSamManekshaw life stringed together. @vickykaushal09 does well. But Don’t miss d fine print.With pride we make movies on our Generals unlike Pakistan becos our’s is a professional not political army.Need 2 keep it insulated. @adgpi
Watch Sam bahadur instead... Such an amazing movie
Saw #SamBahadur and was pleasantly surprised with a housefull theatre.  Content wins. Sadly @jammypants4's criticism of movie feeling like ticking of a checklist feels true.  But the performances are strong enough to ignore that atleast while watching the movie.  Solid 8/10
No doubt amazing movie  #SamBahadur   Best performance #Vickykaushal Movie jitna bhi collection kare Movie hit he....
"Animal ⭐️ 1/2 a non-sense movie in the name of alpha male character.. Ranbir hasn’t come out of Sanju role and forced violence makes movie unbearable at times. Movie might do well at box office due to alpha male character but Bollywood needs to think and do better.  Sam Bahadur ⭐️⭐️⭐️1/2 a good watch, Vicky Kaushal is too good and has done total justice to the role, although movie in some parts feels boring and a little stretched."
"Sam Bahadur is a very well made biopic on one of the greatest soldier India produced.Unlike most war movies produced by Bollywood, there is no jingoism, no effort to glorify war. ⁦@meghnagulzar⁩ has done a wonderful job. Vicky Kaushal has done justice to the role."
"This is real alpha male movie not that chapri trash ""animal'  Jai Maa Kaali Aayo Gorkhali 🔱 #SamBahadur"
Hum apne bahadur dada ji k sath SAM BAHADUR dekh k aaye 💕💕 Dada ji loved it 😍 Everyone should watch it 💕💕 Great movie 🙏
@AmitShah @RSSorg @Harsh_Office @vickykaushal09 It's really a propaganda to promote a specific one movie. Animal having multiple screen in Bharuch but Sambahadur having only one or two screen for ticket booking.
#sambahadurreview #SAMबहादुर #SAMBAHADUR is a movie for mature audience. You need to be calm to appreciate this kind of movie. #VickyKaushal proved again how versatile he is. Well written n well edited with Real location war scenes n some real footages. Definitely not for masses
SAM BAHADUR  Just came out after watching Sam Bahadur..  An excellent military movie with good research   My rating ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  @vickykaushal09 👏👏  Jai Hind 🇮🇳
And what about Sam Bahadur? A pro-congress movie. You will not say anything because it doesn't favour your agenda.  #SamBahadur #AnimalTheMovie
The Fact of the Matter is that #SamBahadur is Much Better than #AnimalTheFilm .. in terms of Story and Screenplay .. Which is Missing in the 2nd half of Animal Movie
Sam bahadur get to know alot about the soldiers personality  How should a soldier behave  He should not loose a hope Should not loot the people of other countries  Should not misbehave with females  Also if they are of enemy countries   But Animal movie totally opposite of this.
A thread on why I watched sam bahadur rather Animal   Sam bahadur is the real life based movie where Animal is totally fiction
Sam Bahadur is excellent movie. You can watch it twice thrice without getting bored. Wonderful job @RonnieScrewvala sir.
"#SamBahadur - Despite being a Bio-pic of a decorated war hero, the movie offers strong political drama in the 2nd half..  The interactions between Late PM Smt. #IndiraGandhi Ji and Field Marshall #SamManekshaw   Don't miss it! 👍"
"What a movie!   #MustWatch #SamBahadur  is the most outstanding movie of the year, depicting how the army and politics work. It brilliantly portrays Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw.   Vicky Kaushal's acting is exceptional.  @vickykaushal09 @meghnagulzar"
Why failed?  Did any one asked what u prefer or like in your life? Then respect others liking as well.. Why u want people to watch malegaon ka super star kallu bhai urf Vicky kaushal movie in theaters? 😂😂😂 #Animal #SamBahadur #SandeepReddyVanga

"What To Watch: 4. Movie Recommendation 2 of the Week: Sam Bahadur (The film pays commendable attention to detail, meticulously depicting Manekshaw's illustrious career, which played a pivotal role in shaping India's borders.)"
"Sam Bahadur is an average movie. It does not do justice to the stature of the Field Marshal. Vicky Kaushal’s efforts at capturing the FMs mannerisms are exaggerated and reduce him to nearly a caricature.  The manner in which Sam was hounded by the Army establishment, which was a stooge of the then govt in power, is one of the main axis which any movie on Sam must explore. This movie fails to do that adequately. Getting the uniform/accoutrements/drill correct was a given since ADGPI was the clearing agency. Meghna Gulzar deserves credit for at least attempting this subject which no one touched till now. But the best biopic of Sam is yet to come."
#SamBahadur holds well on Monday.   Day 4 - ₹ 3.50 Cr   Total - ₹ 29.05 cr nett  #VickyKaushal #BoxOffice
"With movies like Baazi, Uri, Sardar Udham Singh and Sam Bahadur Vicky Kaushal is already a Bollywood Lieutenant."
Agar Animal movie Dekhli ho to koi Sam bahadur ka bhi review de do..   #AnimalMovie #SamBahadurReview
Thank you for understanding that this is not the right movie which needs to be seen by anyone..go and watch sam bahadur the real hero of india..

Both movies are indeed masterpieces for sure.. but #SamBahadur is ❤️
Excellent movie #SamBahadur. #VickyKaushal is not in his colours. He is coloured all Sam Manekshaw. Respect brother @vickykaushal09 #VickyKForNationalAwards

Yin and Yang . Both are important for movies to grow as a whole. #ANIMAL #SamBahadur
"You should also watch #SamBahadur Jiya. I've seen both the movies and Sam Bahadur seemed more worth it than #Animal!  Ikr both movies are very different from EO, but here I'm obviously talking about the story which is okey okey in Animal.  Animal is pure Action pack Btw!"
All the Bangladeshi have to much watch #sambahadur movie

Jabki sam bahadur movie jada achi hai aur vicky kaushal toh kamal ka actor hai hi
Story of a movie can be based on Wikipedia but you can't write Screenplay loosely based on Wikipedia. #SamBahadur
It's not masala movie ... It's story and screenplay driven story with utmost Ranbir's performance. And that Sam bahadur I watched it was good but felt like documentary. No wars . Sam did great war . But no wars scene. That's people choose animal.
"love or hate Animals, pls watch Sam Bahadur. Don't miss this gem of a movie."

A whole lot of emotions and excitement unfolded when team Sam बहादुर got the opportunity to shoot inside Field Marshal Sam Bahadur's real car. 🇮🇳🫡 Take a look at the BTS video!   #Samबहादुर in cinemas now!
"I liked the trailer. I watched Drop 1 in a Sam Bahadur screening and the mostly middle-aged crowd found the jokes to be funny. Family humor hai movie ka, won't be an issue.  Ek aadha jagah de-ageing filter ko abhi bhi thoda refine karna imo. Hope they do that."
Everybody watching a stupid movie like Animal but Sam Bahadur deserves much more eyes. Fantastic acting by Vicky. He deserves much more applause than is currently being offered.
#AnimalTheMovie is red hot on box office!!  #SamBahadur is to be watched.  #Chithha is an amazing movie on Hotstar.
The audience is showering #SamBahadur with immense love! 🎬🇮🇳 Have you watched the movie yet?  Now screening at INOX! Ticket link: inoxmovies.com . . . #SamBahadurMovie #SanyaMalhotra #FatimaSanaShaikh #VickyKaushal
How's Sam Bahadur Movie??
Here Vicky Kaushal failed to deliver as an Actor  In his career he is working in same genre event/biopic (Uri-S U S-SB) atleast he should choose new and fresh contents And movie review of sam bahadur is not top notch it's like documentary. It's totally depends on audience ❤️
#SamBahadur se bore ho kar #Animal dekhne chale gaye 😂😂  #RanbirKapoor #AnimalTheMovie
"@AmitShah @PMOIndia @rashtrapatibhv @RanveerOfficial @SrBachchan Today's generation like violence so Animal is getting hipe bt discipline n commitment n honour is les appreciated 4 Sambahadur,people need peace not Animal, mean acting is good for both movies bt Animal is Animal."
"Watching #SamBahadur insted of #AnimalTheMovie , we are not the same. I like the story in movies instead of illogical scenes. #ThankYouSamBahadur"
Watched the movie #SamBahadur today. Extremely poorly made film…and just because you pay a music director doesn’t mean that there was not a second that there was no background score. Utterly rubbish film made on such a great person! @meghnagulzar
"""Saturday night thrill! 🎬 Sneaked into Sam Bahadur with friends, 10:45 PM show on the 6th floor. Guards didn't notice, found the ticket counter on the 5th floor. Seats were empty, watched the whole movie without tickets! 😅 #MovieNight #SamBahadur #Adventure"""
"Just came back after seeing #SamBahadur to excellent news of #BJP victorious in MP , Rajasthan & Chattisgarh ! Wow . Good day - Good movie & Good Results ."
Quite a wholesome movie experience with #SamBahadur  Very well portrayed by @vickykaushal09 #CitizenKamath
Pannu was last seen in movies like Blurr and Tadka. Kaushal's Sam Bahadur was released on December #Dunki

Sam bahadur oh ho what a movie... If it not clash with animal sure shot 250 cr wali movi thi
The Movie Sam Bahadur is excellent movie made on any biopic story. Moreover Sunny Deol must learn how to act . Excellent acting by Vikky Kaushal.
"We Indians don't deserve movie like Sam Bahadur nor a real hero like Sam Maneckshaw but S*it like Animal and senseless Khan movies.... Americans made ""Patton"" a superhit movie in 1970 and we can't even celebrate our real heros... What a shame!!"
"#SamBahadur 3/5  Sam's character looks great. No attention has been given to show the stories related to Sam's working style/strategy properly that made him so successful, few popular stories hv been given place in movie.  Indira Gandhi's & Sam's wife's characters look below avg."

better watch #SamBahadur sweetie because it's not just movie but biography of strong personality.
Watched it yesterday(4th December 2023). The very same day 52 years ago(4th December 1971) India attacked  east Pakistan and Bangladesh was formed.  Great movie. @vickykaushal09 #SamBahadur

"Watched Sam Bahadur and though the movie is kind of forgettable with decent storyline but one thing stands out is Vicky! The way that man has embodied Sam Manekshaw is INCREDIBLE. The body language, his dialect every thing is so on point. He makes the movie worth watching."
"Yesterday, on the eve IndoPak war for liberation of Bangladesh, on a sudden impulse, went to see the Movie 'Sam Bahadur'.  Saw the movie from up close, from the 1st row, since all rows were already booked.  A very nice movie. Great performance by everyone, esp by Vicky Kaushal👌"
"in spite of very good movie #SamBahadur, there is no discussion or hype, why?"
#Sambahadur Movie ka date last year hi announced tha.. Kyuki Indo-Pak War 1971 isi samay hua tha.. Aur FM Sam Manekshaw Sir uss samay Army Chief the.. Toh yeh sahi samay tha..  Animal apna release 1 week peeche kar sakta tha..

"Purely as a movie without any bias towards its content, it was not a good movie imo. Saw Sam Bahadur the next day, immediate regrets on wasting money the previous day"
"Sam Bahadur was time well spent  Not sure how much is fact and how much fiction, but the movie itself was fairly well put together, Vicky Kaushal's acting was on point, enjoyed it! 😁"
"Had the misfortune of watching Animal  The best part of the movie was the 15second trailer of Sam Bahadur prior to the movie starting, which will hopefully be better 😅"
"Even though this movie is not making much business but this movie has to be ""movie of the year"" only becoz of @vickykaushal09. Seamless & pure class acting. Anyone can act where you are  drinking and smoking but to enact a super hero like Sam bahadur requires outstanding effort."
"Sam Bahadur is a movie to watch to see what a powerful woman and man acts like. How they be brave and charming, deal with partners, friendships, and challenges — on the level that can potentially impact literally two countries of the world.  Vicky Kaushal is a delight to watch in Sam Bahadur. The writing of the film perfectly blends English, Hindi, and Urdu alike the poets of those times. Exactly what you would expect from a film written and directed by @meghnagulzar and produced by @RonnieScrewvala"
#SamBahadur is true masterpiece. @vickykaushal09 doing a great job.  #Animal movie dekhne ke baad Ranvir ke haise khun kharaba to nahin kar sakte per #SamBahadur dekhne ke baad Sam Bahadur ki tarah chal to sakte hai. 😊  #SamBahadurReview
"If you Wish To See “Lust, Glamour, Revenge, High Headedness, and No Logic  Movie Go For #AnimalMovie   If you Like “Integrity, Character Strength, Patriotism and Relevance to History” Go For #SamBahadur   Acting wise both Movies are Good."

Best reply on a review of Animal movie😅😂  #AnimalBoxOffice #AnimalPark #AnimalMovie #GTA6trailer #sambahadur
"In the world full of Animals, I watched #SamBahadur and it was beautiful. A perfect film to watch with family. #VickyKaushal was really amazing in that. Felt like I am watching real Sam Manekshaw on screen. Take ur kids and parents to watch this movie and u will not regret."
I've zero doubts that Sam Bahadur is an excellent movie and vicky's performance is amazing too. but collection and hype wise ANIMAL has devoured it completely and that's the truth.
It's better to watch movies like #Sambahadur #Territory a Marathi movie etc
"Please do go and watch #SamBahadur as it’s a story about a remarkable man in uniform each one of us will be proud of👌  And please don’t waste your time & money by watching the most insane, senseless, blood thirsty, vulgar, obnoxious, gore and dark movie called #Animal🤦🏻"
"I am unwell, on bed rest since last few days… Extremely keen to watch #Animal and #SamBahadur… Will certainly watch soon… Till then, share *your* opinion on the movies, when you watch.  Wishing Team #Animal and Team #SamBahadur a super-successful innings at the #BO."
"#Jawan and #pathan were single release and released during festival period, got benefitted from holidays for first 4 days!  🌟#Animal had none of the benefits or prestige, plus  🌟 it clashed with #SamBahadur , also 🌟it's 3.30hrs long movie,  🌟A Rated, still it's doing wonders!"
You won't regret watching Animal Before sam bahadur..   Sam bahadur is a good movie but the Animal is even better movie with A certificate..

"Average haters... Trailer se kya romantic movie lagi thi kya tum dono ganduon ko... Content ke liye movie dekhni bhi hai, baad me rona bhi hai. Sam bahadur dekh lete. Aur kaun se gaaon ke theatre me gaye the jo sab tumhare jaise gaandu ek theatre me gather huye the. CMK!"

"Watched this movie on the 4th of December(a special day by the history of the event). Phenomenal acting done by @vickykaushal09 and the way he did the exact replication of the #SamBahadur, is just wondeful! Hats off to the team as well for working on minute details @meghnagulzar."
Which Movie Between Animal Vs Sam Bahadur Was FLOP Or HIT . . #animal #SamBahadur https://64live.org/which-movie-between-animal-vs-sam-bahadur-was-flop-or-hit/
"#Animal is just an Animal knows nothing about rules, regulation. An overdragged film. Bobby Deol's role was how much he was shown in the trailer. But appreciate #RanbirKapoor performance. 5/10 #SamBahadur real story of a legend no nonsence. 9/10 Better movie suffering again"
Seeing box office collections of Animal over Sam Bahadur clearly show how toxic our society is going!! At least give some love to our legend!! Choice is yours what to see and not what to see but just see movie like movie!!
Sam bahadur ko release nehi karna chahiye tha animal ke saath....iss movie ko show nehi mil raha heiii Mera home town mein dono hall per animal ka show chal Raha heii
"#Animal movie sabne dekh li hogi but ye movie bhaut kam logo ne dekhi hogi, ye humare desh ke Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw Sir 🫡 ki biopic hai, please ye movie bhi dekh lo hume apne Desh ke real heros ke baare me pata hona chahiye   Jai Hind 🇮🇳 #SamBahadur #SalmanKhan"
"Parkaya pravesh ke bare me suna tha, Vicky Kaushal ko Field Marshal General Sam Mankeshaw ka role karte hue dekh ke vishwas bhi hua! Easily the performance of 2023!  Given the span they had to cover, it's understandable that the movie looks rushed. #SamBahadur"
Movies like Sam Bahadur deserve theatrical release and movies like Animal should be reserved for ott.
Sam Bahadur...i watch movies 4 ntrtanmnt .dont knw y people r gng mad 4 Animal..the content is so negative..most web series hv crime based content wch is so negative. cant digest so much negativity....v shd make shows or movies like Panchayat which have more family based content.
"Saw #SamBahadur yesterday & was happy to see a movie which gave attention to accuracy  The DC3 during Srinagar war with VP905 tail number, WWII fighters & Mizo insurgency scenes, these small to small details made this movie a must watch  @vickykaushal09 as Manekshaw was brilliant"
#SamBahadur is a good film. Do watch it for @vickykaushal09 ‘s acting. It’s a bit slow but those who are interested in such kind of history will surely enjoy the movie.
Now tell me where your bollywood director is and what about the collection of Sambahadur instead of we all about the content and previous work of directors which are the best movies ever.
#SamBahadur must watch movie he  No religion angle kuch nahi but public ko brutality itni pasand hai 😐 ke pucho hi mat baki mene dekhi hai 😶‍🌫️ ek number movie 🍿🎥
What a wonderful Movie #SamBahadur  Enjoyed seeing your work Sweety @vickykaushal09

"Neither the then President Pratibha Patil, nor the then PM, MMS, nor the defence minister A K Antony, nor the three Service Chiefs were present at the cremation ceremony of Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw.  Was this shown in the movie #SamBahadur ?"
SamBahadur was boring 🥱 Vicky Kaushal kept the whole movie alive single-handedly
Meghna Gulzar is not the right person to direct a biopic or true incident movie. #SamBahadur
Vanga loves this attention. This attention makes his average movie a super hit.   No noise about Sam Bahadur at all due to Vanga's nuisance
My sister and a cousin sister wanted me to book tickets of animal movie for them through my source as the movie is housefull in our nearest cineplex.i assured them to go meanwhile I booked the tickets of Sam bahadur......now she called me in a very annoying mood.😂😂😂😂
"Just watched the movie #SamBahadur and thought that, combination of NaMo amd Sam would have been deadly imo"
Heartwarming to see movies like OMG2 and Sam Bahadur doing well!
"You are asking about philosophy of Sam Bahadur is not it ? Director is Meghna Gulzar ,who got exposed for her subtle lies she showed in Raazi And in this movie,she did not showed the black works that congress did during that time it just showed how congress was innocent"
#SamBahadur Day Wise Collection -  Day 1 - ₹6.25CR Day 2 - ₹9.25CR Day 3 - ₹10.30CR Day 4 - ₹3.50CR  Total - ₹29.30CR  The Drop shouldn't have been this Big yesterday...  Might End at or Below ₹60CR.  #VickyKaushal #SanyaMalhotra #FatimaSanaSheikh #MeghnaGulzar

"Animal nonsense non motivational and full of crime, disrespect of women, arrogance attitude and aggression. Such movies should be banned  Sam bahadur representing commitment for nation. Motivational and inspirational for teenage and growing mind."
"Watched both the movie but Sambahadur on its release date. I don't need to mention about our spoiled generation, and Animal is just doing the things of puting oil on fire. SamBahadur an inspiration for youth. A must watch movie 9/10. Vicky you rock . Animal 7/10. Bobby nailed it."

"Saw Sam Bahadur in the cinema last week..... a nice movie, but Sam did not walk and talk so fast and I am also not sure Sam called everyone ""Sweetie"" - he call me ""Boy"" - many interesting anecdotes were missing, but I guess Ronnie Screwalla wanted to be politically correct....."
"Guys  Please do watch vicky kaushal starring “Sam bahadur”  Movies like “Animal” might give you goosebumps with unrealistic, heightened emotions, but the real ALPHA is/was “Sam Manekshaw”  If you want to know how badass and how real MEN talk, listen to this and I will rest my case 👇🏼"
Animal or Sam bahadur dono hi shaandaar movies hai kaash alag alag time par aati to behtar hota Sam bahadur jesi movies ke liye...
For Acting yes but you can understand there mentality they likes #Animal but not  #SamBahadur . Everybody is free to watch whatever movie but honestly tell me what are we learning or gaining from #Animal 🤔🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏
"Watched #SamBahadur. I must say it’s a very well written, directed movie. @vickykaushal09 has brilliantly portrayed field marshal #SamManekshaw through his acting. Must watch movie to understand how #IndianArmy was at work every time there was need of crucial decision making."

So far this year only 2 good movies which came …  12th fail  And Sam Bahadur . None other except hype.
I don’t see a reason why people are not watching #samBahadur . Movie like this being made once in a while. People should watch it with full family. @vickykaushal09 @sanyamalhotra07  won the heart. 👏
"Let’s see which movie wins, #Animal or #SamBahadur. Vote for your favourite star, Ranbir Kapoor or Vicky Kaushal?"
Bhai Sam bahadur is a superb movie Vicky has done outstanding acting
I can't understand why very few people are interested in #SamBahadur movie. People should watch movies like #SamBhadur with their children so that they can learn about the #bravery and #sacrifices of our national heroes
Agreed.. i hope sam bahadur movie  is as best as the person itself

Such a sorry state it's that movie like #Gadar do 1000cr business whereas #OMG2 has to survive to pull the audience. Similarly #Animal is laughing away to bank but #SamBahadur will do a luke warm business. That's what it has become abt. I don't blame anyone other than WE ONLY+
There are differences between entertainment and Reality. The whole movie has been made for entertainment purposes. So we should treat it like that way. But people should watch Sam Bahadur too. That is actually a nice movie.
"Watched #SamBahadur  yesterday, The way #VickyKaushal Played the character of ""Sam manekshaw"" is a delight to watch and outstanding performance.  Rating:⭐⭐⭐  Overall one time watchable movie.  The direction of meghna gulzar is good 👍. Performances of all characters are Nice."
"After being one of the serine movies of the decade, people are still intrigued in something which makes them animal. #sambahadur #SamManekshaw"
Sam Bahadur's Biography (movie) mentioned that Bomdila is with Assam but originally from the very beginning it's with Arunachal Pradesh. You made a mistake in the script/misleading. Please correct it with OTT Play. @ZeeMusicCompany @RonnieScrewvala @meghnagulzar @ArunachalCMO
Sam Bahadur is Better in Every part of it. Animal is ok to watch its just the hype of the movie. #Bollywood #sambahadur #AnimalTheMovie
People choose #AnimalMovie which glorifying misogyny. And on the other hand in #SamBahadur the movie glorifying our war heroes. But still people chose #AnimalDisaster against patriotism. #SamManekshaw
Bhai sahab director jihadan thi sam bahadur movie ki jisne pichhli biopic Raazi me indian army ko badnam kiya he aap ispar thodi jankari nikalo
"vicky kaushal is a phenomenal actor 🥺 what a beautiful man.  but, in totality, this movie could’ve been so much better, when you know the kind of potential meghna gulzar has. felt more like a documentary.  but, watching Sam Bahadur over Animal, any day 🩷"
#Salaar is #Animal movie  And   #Dunki is Sam Bahadur movie.
Give honest opinion: which movie is better? #RanbirKapoor𓃵 #sambahadur #AnimalTheMovie #AnimalPark #SRK                RT👇                                                      Like👇
"This is actually the first SRK trailer I loved after many years. Pathan was meh and Jawan was soild for a mass movie (bollywood level). But Dunki is very good. I don't think I liked any trailer this much other than Sam Bahadur this year, and I loved that movie."
That’s a choice bro.  Sam Bahadur ko isse compare mat karo both movies are different stories comparison makes no sense
Exactly! Most people are saying femistists aree opposing it. It's just not about that. What are we trying to teach young minds? What's the message by this movie anyway. Do watch Sam Bahadur...it's worth time and money.
It’s too good a movie👍 Vicky Kaushal has completely transformed himself into Sam Bahadur in this movie! Simply brilliant!👏🏻 Though some aspects like his shabby treatment by IG & how in her insecurity she downgraded the armed forces…have been omitted but still a brilliant watch!
"#AnimalMovie is filled with misogynistic & toxic masculinity which the director thinks is all about being Alpha Male, just like in Kabir Singh. My biggest mistake of 2023 was to watch this movie and skip #SamBahadur  I don't believe in regrets but this one hurts."

"@imvangasandeep FYI Alpha male isn't what ur movie leads are (try watching #SamBahadur in nearby theatre for correction)  Also, as you can't express feelings without slapping, forceful kissing or abusing..hope that's not how you express to ur loved ones & vice-versa!  Take help!"
After a long time it’s a movie where the actor wasn’t an actor even for a minute. Felt like #SamManekshaw was portraying himself. What a depiction by @vickykaushal09 @meghnagulzar #SamBahadur #SamBahadurReview #bollywoodmovies
"@meghnagulzar thanks for “SamBahadur”. Loved every minute of it. And coincidence was last night when we were watching the movie, we realised it was 04th December night. 😊"
Ese ghatiya movies dekhte he kyu ho or fir SM me post kerte ho taki or movie ke promotion ho Plz watch #SamBahadur everyone 🙏🏻
Watched #SamBahadur. What a brilliant movie! Thanks to all the film crew.  And hats off to the Indian armed forces for keeping us safe in such a hostile environment. My deepest gratitude to Sam Manekshaw and entire armed forces.
Another reason for sambahadur to work better is pathetic script and sick mentality of animal movie.. acting is good but its pathetic movie
"Watched SAM BAHADUR, the movie is good but it can be improved ...."
"Just how after taste is important in food, after experience is important in movies these days.  #Sambahadur is a well crafted cinema just like #Animal . But it leaves no points to talk about at the end. But Animal separates the audience, and start a war afterwards.  GENIUS"
"Watched #SamBahadur with @pathy_a last night at Inox, RMZ Galleria.  Nice movie. Had goosebumps in some scenes.  Worth watching. 8/10 from me.  ❤️❤️❤️"
I mean a lady like u whose background is defense analysis just wasted her money and time to watch a crap movie instead of Sam Bahadur 🤮🤮🤮
The stupendous love people give to top notch violence in films depicted via toxic men as compared to real heroes also shown in movies who actually worked towards the country's unity shows the real mentality.  #SamBahadur vs #Animal  Also me comparing based on movies 🤦‍♀️
"In a world full of animal movie fans, watch Sambahadur!"
"I went for #SamBahadur with low expectations, but the movie completely exceeded them. The captivating storytelling, visuals, and performances specially @vickykaushal09 were not only outstanding but felt like looking at the real SamBahadur, genuinely impressed. 1/3"
Bhai total 5k screens hai sirf Hindi me usme se half to Animal ke pas hai kuch Sam Bahadur ke pas hai or kuch mumbai theater me local movies lgi hoti hai or Dunki sirf Hindi me release hogi agr usme se b bchi hui screens Salaar ko de degi to uske pas sirf 3000 bhi nhi rhegi
"The collection of #Animal is almost 10x more than #Sambahadur. I watched the master piece by Meghna Gulzar in each frame, every dilouge of the movie, I’m shocked to understand that people are not eager to watch the life story of a real hero."
"If you wanted to see an alpha male character choose a better example and should have promoted Sam bahadur. When rw women are calling out cheating other aspects in useless woke movies, rw men only glorify such habits when a male lead is portrayed doing so. Rw men failed!"

#vickykaushal What a movie and what a performance by Vicky Sam Bahadur ! Salute to you Vicky ..
Okay guys time for the review. Me and my fiance watched this movie today and it's done so well . Everyone has acted incredibly . Also shoutout to Vicky kaushal who looked absolutely like Sam bahadur. Like such good voice modulation and posture . I mean incredible acting
"what a brilliant movie & a phenomenal actor vicky kaushal is. he embodied field marshall effortlessly. these are the movies audience should swam to. heroic story of a man more incredible than words can express. I hope when he looks down he can hear India say ""I'm ok"" #SamBahadur"
"After Vicky's film getting ignored the whole month by every critic and media in general, I am shameless going to retweet every comparison tweet of Sam Bahadur and Janwar 🥰 Sam Bahadur is THAT film that will tell Indian audience who like nonsense movies that their choice is sh*t."
"#SamBahadur is a heavily underrated movie. The acting of @vickykaushal09 in this movie is so good that I feel he deserves a national award for this film. This is a story of an actual alpha male.  The line ‘We are gentlemen, when you see begum hands in pocket’ ❤️"
I saw the movie Sam Bahadur. Movie shows the TRUE love for the nation by the Soldiers.  And urge People of Bharat to see the movie for the Pride provided to the Nation by Our Extraordinary Soldiers.
I genuinely want more movies should be released every year as we have witnessed with Sam Bahadur. #SamBahadurReview #MovieReview #VickyKaushal #SamManekshaw
"Then 1962 along with North east insurgency , political turmoil of Delhi, Nehru to Indira  , then 1971.  India was eventful from 1947 to 70s. It celebrates Sam Bahadur but feels like documentary than a movie at times.@colhunnybakshi @ColSanjayPande @Maverickmusafir"
"@sam bahadur incredible movie! @vickykaushal09.  A masterpiece. Thank for  the truth. Our generation needs more movies like this, not just mindless entertainment. Sir,I'm grateful to you for choosing to make this. You're an inspiration to me. Jai Hind! 🇮🇳 #SamBahadur #Inspiration"
"Makers and Writters of @animalmovie2023 ,kya phoonk movie banai hai bhai…., Wasted my Rs 250,#SamBahadur is way more better and classy movie  than this movie 🎥. #AnimalMovieReview"
Sam Bahadur is indeed an amazing take on the life of the late Field Martial Sam Manekshaw. But the movie could have been legendary had they included actual snippets of the wars where Sam played a crucial role. Vickey Kaushal has been impeccable as always.
Just finished watching #SamBahadur & I was told #VickyKaushal starred in it. Didn't find him in the movie 😉
Very surprised when I saw Sam Bahadur movie collection Very beautiful movie but people just don’t have any interest
"Why do say ""we failed as an audience"" People are looking for entertainment. Animal is a well made movie with very good performance as well. It is stupid to compete with such a movie. Sam Bahadur would have done better if it was released solo."
Sam bahadur has less action compared to Animal and ppl like to watch complex action driven movie…and most ppl are not even aware that film like sambahadur is released coz of very less hype. Animal gathered hype due to its trailer and songs…agree or cry but its a fact.
Also I am not getting the comparison between Sam bahadur and Animal..yes Sam bahadur was a true example of alpha male but ppl go to cinemas to watch a story.  Sam bahadur is a great movie but average story and people are prefering to watch Animal coz its different.
Yaa definitely ky kaam kiya h Vicky ne pata ni ek hype chal jati h log pagal ho jate h bhed chal me ky esa h animal me violent movie h family ke sath dekh nhi skte women disrespect h ky hi concept h Sam bahadur dekho bhai sab jake
"#SamBahadur what movie. Blessed to have Meghna Gulzar, the entire star cast for bringing the GIANT #sam Maneckshaw out of the history books and into the hearts of each and every Bharatiya"
#SamBahadur shows excellent jump on Saturday as Positive Word of Mouth came into play.   Eying ₹ 25 cr + Weekend.   Day 1 - ₹ 6.25 Day 2 - ₹ 9 cr  Total - ₹ 15.25 cr nett
Leki yaar bhai Animal ka kya craze hai ground level pe youth me bc mere coaching me aaj tak kisi ke muh se movie sabd nahi suna maine aaj teacher aur bChe sab Animal aur Sam bahadur ki characha kar rahe the
Just watch #SamBahadur I can just say what a mind blowing actor @vickykaushal09 is he has done fabulous work but other casting is very weak specially @sanyamalhotra07 looks dumb in the movie while @fattysanashaikh looks as if she is giving audition why cast just coz of names ???
Chu....Abhi sambahadur movie release hua na to tum bi bano sambahadur...
Sam Bahadur OTT Wali Movie Hai 👍
"Sam bahadur boring hai,not worth of cinema. Animal is proper hall worthy movie"
"Sam Bahadur is a good movie for Meghana Gulzar, till now nothing has been able to cross Talwar!!"
"#SamBahadur JUMPS on Day 2 [Sat], with key metros recording EXCELLENT footfalls… A bigger number on Day 3 [Sun] is clearly on the cards… Fri 6.25 cr, Sat 9 cr. Total: ₹ 15.25 cr. #India biz.  The real test begins tomorrow: the make-or-break Day 4 [Mon]… It needs to stay super-steady at its best-performing centres to leave a mark."
"#SamBahadur stands on its feet, despite a hurricane called #Animal… Riding on glowing word of mouth, the day-wise growth - mainly at key metros - saw the biz witnessing a spike on Day 2 and 3… Fri 6.25 cr, Sat 9 cr, Sun 10.30 cr. Total: ₹ 25.55 cr. #India biz.  A solo release would’ve benefited the film tremendously, since #Animal has eroded its biz… The weekend numbers would’ve been higher than what it is today, had it averted this clash.  Going forward, Day 4 [Mon] is extremely crucial, it has to score in the same vicinity or thereabouts as Day 1 [Fri]."
"Loved Sam Bahadur. A must watch film for all generations to know the history of our country, and to understand the courage and sacrifices made by Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw. Vicky Kaushal has acted so well that it feels like Sam Bahadur is right in front of us."
Watched Sam Bahadur boring AF! Sure VK was good!  Will watch Animal tom. I want a movie experience. Not a moral science class. Had enough of it in a missionary convent school.
Sam bahadur is not working coz its a very average film…compared to animal. Animal is a negative character movie and geneal public is not glorifying him as alpha male…might be some of his fans but not neutrals.
Most awaited movie MAWAALI #mawaali #mawaalithefilm #marathi #marathimovie #Bollywood #ChennaiRains #ChennaiFloods #GOLD #AnimalTheFilm #actionmovie #AnimalReview #Blockbuster #sanjayniranjan #hallmarkstudioz #sanamproductionsindia #SamBahadur https://x.com/atulmohanhere/status/1731645796989444330?t=CV6b-X-mYDXpKphpHGxUxQ&s=09
Oh come on stop whining movies are supposed to be entertaining.. they should have released Sam Bahadur some other time of the year .. people always choose what they like .. why the fast food and junk foods sell more than healthy foods ? What else did you expect!!
Sambahadur movie is really nice. Vicky acted really well. People should watch this movie for sam manekshaw. First field marshal of india.
Sam bahadur farzi movie hai. Nationalism ko capitalise kar rahe hai. Congress ke blunder hide kiye hai or unko glorify kiya hai.

Woke gang only supporting on SM 😂 no one is watching his movie in theatre. I can guarantee animal ki ticket jyada li hogi unhone as compared to Sam bahadur
#SamBahadurReview  Very good movie - Sam Bahadur !!
Best movies this year till now 1.Omg2 2.Jailer 3.Bandaa 4.Animal 5.Sam bahadur
"@meghnagulzar @vickykaushal09 @SamBahadur I am sure you both would have changed at your core, at a personal level while making this movie! Saluting you and Field Marshal Sam Bahadur, a true Army officer. Vicky deserves an award for doing a wonderful job!!!"
"Exactly, these woke directors are gudd in makng lovy dovey movies only. They shud not touch biopics of the stalwarts of history..tho vky is a good actor, done an army movie..that only doesn't qualifies him to carry the persona of sam sir. He was a different breed.  #SamBahadur #"
"clash mei sam bahdaur hai omg2 ya salaar thodi hai, sam bahadur almost 90%+ audience will never watch movies like animal both have very diff audience"
Both #Animal and #SamBahadur Have Passed the Monday Test Woth FLYING Colours 💥  Lifetime Prediction -  - Animal - ₹500cr+ *HINDI* - Sam Bahadur - ₹65cr - ₹75cr  #RanbirKapoor #VickyKaushal
Movies like #Pippa & #SamBahadur should be shown to youngsters of our neighbour in the east who celebrated India's loss in the #CWC2023 . They need more than a gentle reminder 🙂
Very powerful and energetic movie..  To i request the all indian ARMY Aspirants seen this movie necessary.. #Hero_of1971 #SamBahadur #Pippa
Very well done biography W MOVIE #SamBahadur
#SamBahadur Its 4th Dec. I just saw #Samबहादुर. Such a Decent movie. There is a references of d date 4th Dec in this movie. I just wanted to share this coincidence By d way such movies are really inspirational. but sad part is every1 is running towards movies like #AnimalTheMovie
They guyz ignored sam Bahadur...Sabki apni choice hai but legend ka nam juda tha us movie se.. Uske samne ye ghatia si..!
Reading the reviews of #SamBahadur I was a little sceptical that it may be boring. But  it was not. I really liked it. It was an engaging movie. And what can I say about Vicky Kaushal. What a talent💓. Brilliant performance like always. So happy to see him shine.
I sat next to my twitter / X friend while watching #Sambahadur and didn't realise it was my friend until I saw post praising the movie 😆  Small world
"Just two words - Brilliant movie! Go watch.. I had gone in expecting how typically Bollywood screws up this genre but was left delightfully happy at the end of it.. also, my respect for Vicky Kaushal has increased ten fold after this! Hats off 🔥 #SamBahadur #FieldMarshallSamManekshaw"

"@vickykaushal09 saw the movie #SamBahadur , I am very choosy in watching movies in theatre and it was really a vgood decision 👍👍"
I watched Sam Bahadur today and it's 10/10 from my side. Not a minute of movie is boring. Animal might be a good movie but can't sit for 3.5 hrs for a movie. So I'll pirate it.
"sam bahadur ko shows hi nai mile, i planned to watch both the movies same day, scene aisa hai ki ek din mei sam bahadur ko 2 out of 18 shows diya hai inn pvr waalon ne 15 show animal aur ek koi religional film"
Ye koi clash hei nahi hai Sam bahadur koi bade actor ki ye koi badi movie nahi hai naahi kuch khaas buisness  kar rahi hai agar animal solo release hoti tab bhi itna hei karti dono movies ki audience alag hai clash se koi fark nahi para hai
Bus agar vicky Animal ka hero hota aur Ranbir sam bahadur movie ka hero hota to collection main major difference hota
"#DunkiTrailer Watch it definitely. But also watch #SamBahadur. It's a must watch movie. One of the country's greatest heroes. He deserves to be known by a lot of Indians, old & young both & by the next generations. Watch the movie & know the man. Vicky has done a very good job."
"People will do anything and then call it "" individual liberty"".  Because there individual liberty is less patriotic.  I asked a girl yesterday about animal and sam bahadur ( sam manekshaw ) , which movie she was going to watch. Then she asked me ""Who is sam manekshaw ?"""
Just finished watching Sam Bahadur. Amazing movie. 100% would recommend to go watch it
"#SamBahadur passes Monday test, falls less than 50% from 1st Friday...Collects around 3.75cr-4cr...  Total = 6.25+9+10.3+4= 29.5cr+  #VickyKaushal"
"Sam Bahadur: Ok Ok movie Vicky kaushal as Field Marshal Sam Bahadur has done phenomenal work Fatima Sana Sheikh as Indira is miscast Screenplay is not good, it's average. Story doesn't hold you throughout the movie. It can give you good information about history"
These numbers when a movie like sam bahadur.... A movie about a legend wasn't even in competition when it comes to the number games ...forget about doing better inspite of releasing together. The extent of misogyny is alarming!!!!
Sam Bahadur is a very well made movie. Vicky's acting is so so good
"There are some unnecessary scenes which could have been avoided and few who haven't made justice to their roles, but not going to reveal much on those. There could have some improvements in terms of the screenplay, but overall a good movie. Watch it Sam Bahadur. 🫡"
"'Sam Bahadur' - Movie centers on Major Indian Events and Sam Bahadur's pivotal role. They have done a good job in condensing his 40+ year career in to a 2hr movie. His extensive career deserve a series of episodes, a prospect worth considering for the future.  1/2"
I'm not a fan of watching movies. I just admire him so I want to watch Sam Bahadur.
So #SamBahadur which was a great movie has 5 times less collections but #Animal which is based on all the wrong things is making more money because people need to debate if its a good movie or not 👏👏🤡
"Sam Bahadur is a fantastic movie.   Vicky deserves a national award, hell even an Oscar nomination.   There was one last 2-4 sec moment where Sam Manekshaw broke the 4th wall.  Amazing casting, and responsibly curated songs. :)"
Must watch a very interesting video of Bharat's most revered military leader Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw! 🇮🇳👌👌👍👍   #SamBahadur Movie 👍👍 #SamBahadurReview @vickykaushal09
Is SamBahadur worth watching as a movie? or does it feel like watching a documentary?
"If I have to watch out of these 2 I will prefer Sam bahadur ,dont like action /violent movies much... Was impressed by Animal trailer and also supporting Animal for Ranbir kapoor..."

Animal getting more PR for being a bullshit movie then Sam Bahadur for being an inspirational movie shows everything that's wrong with the current media

Sam Bahadur is such a flat movie 2/5.
"When the look poster of #SamBahadur was released I was already excited for this movie. @meghnagulzar direction @RonnieScrewvala RSVP production and Vicky Kaushal. I so loved the movie. It was artistic. Many people have complained a war movie doesn't show war, yes but as Sam says something on the lines battles aren't always fought on the field. The movie goes through his decorated army life with the coinciding changes in the political landscape of India and the sub continent.  The makers didn't take the action route of telling this story. They took more human approach on who Sam Manelshaw was a soldier, a general, a loving husband & a very witty person sweety 😊.  Now coming to the man of the hour #VickyKaushal this was an excellent performance like I said earlier I couldn't find him acting he was living Sam Bahadur. His range as an actor & picking his minute details Vicky has worked really hard. Deserves a national award for this portrayal (tie with Vikrant Massey) Support cast Sanya Malhotra is beautiful. She plays her role brilliantly. Fatima tried her best but her every scene is with Vicky & that's a tough act to match. @Mdzeeshanayyub (I hope this is his handle) is amazing in his role as Yahya Khan, he's so talented we should use him more. All & all I loved the movie, doesn't drag for scene. Yes it doesn't give you the goosebumps, adrenaline rush a war movie generally gives but it's because it stands to these lines ""Sam is here"" & ""everything will be okay""  Please watch this movie, it's very well made and worth to experience at the big screen.  #Bollywood"
"#SamBahadur ⭐️⭐️⭐️  I always had a soft spot for this movie even before it released. I still do! A story waiting to be told, a (super)hero waiting to be known - #SamManekshaw We see him (almost) in real - as #VickyKaushal! Sometimes I fail to laud him enough, in words. I'll try...  VK is Sam from the word go. Oh you wonderboy! He's breathing the same air - from that hunch to sing-song voice, sharp eyes, restrainting smile & (sweetie) charm! He vanishes in Sam's skin just few min into the film. He deserves all the love, praise & even awards!  #MeghnaGulzar by now has created an impression that whatever she creates ought to bring something extraordinary to the table through the stories she picks. It's the same intent again - same heart, soul & everything. But, something still remains amiss!  Presenting Sam's magnamious, heroic life in 2.5 hours can be challenging. MG took the plunge. She delivers well, but SB suffers from bumpy sequence of historical graphs. First half is a struggle in sticking to the timeline. Screenplay gets sloppy at places & characters fall short in leaving a mark.  While #SanyaMalhotra gets pushed  in the side, #FatimaSanaShaikh is unable to translate Indira Gandhi's poise & power to the best. I was impressed by #NeerajKabi playing Pt. Nehru.  SB still has its moments - Sam's eagle eyes & expertise at even guessing the starting date of a war, to raising spirits of his dejected soldiers... When he's in uniform, he's the master of battleground.  Despite the highs & lows, SB is a much-needed tribute to the illustrious life of a man, who gave it all to keep the country's sanity & borders intact, even in the darkest times.  For me, SB belongs to VK. It's evident he's had fun playing the crucial character. He's the bets, & we know it!  Watch it to relive a man's life who got blurred in our history chapters. And, ofcourse for Vicky (one extra star for his hazel eyes!) 🙂  ----- SB - Sam Bahadur VK - Vicky Kaushal MG - Meghna Gulzar"
"Well actually what matters is the story should reach audience...Theatres are just media,some movies are made for cinematic experience..Like animal...And some are made to learn from them.. like sam bahadur....So, audience can watch sam bahadur in theatres or on off mobiles too..."
"the kind of pr Animal had, Sam bahadur didn't. You see 1 week ago I didn't even know that animal is clashing with vicky's movie. I believe many people like me who don't have keen interest in bollywood movies, would have never known it"
Bhai Salaar is a mass movie with disaster trailer but it will get more screens than Sam bahadur
"Kya fayda, people watch movies for entertainment and we all know the number of people watching Sam Bahadur."
I couldn't go for any of these movies due to hectic schedule but will definitely go #Sambahadur in theatre by this weekend and animal on torrent .
"All the actors have played their roles so well, you can't deny that this is one of the best biographies ever made.  Just one point, Upon watching Napoleon, and Sam Bahadur, I felt that a 2-3 hour movie can't do justice to the life stories of people like them.  13/"
"Sir, None can match Sam Bahadur's, yours or even my persona...! Though a good movie, but the real SAM remains to be an enigma, that no one can copy howsoever good professional"
"animal is such a bad movie man, just watch sam bahadur a masterpiece"
Watched both the movies back to back and I enjoyed Animal over Sam Bahadur.   Did you see Animal?
Watch #SamBahadur today @RSVPMovies and vicky kaushal made a great attempt to biograph Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw sir very happy great movie to watch worth money.
At least animal is good movie. It’s different than usual boring love stories.  Didn’t watched Sambahadur yet.
So u should look Sam bahadur..Vicky did better Ranveer Kapoor at the first half of the movie doing his Sanju role 🤷🤷i found that same . He is ofc brillian actor but I think Vicky deserves best actor award
My friend also played a role in Sam Bahadur movie.
Best movie I watched so far this year..#sambahadur #sammanekshaw #IndianArmy #sammanekshawreview #movie
"Yo..all gud,dearest. I was watching a movie yesterday. Which one did u watch? I saw Sam Bahadur with my friends 😊😊"
"Watched the movie Sam bahadur last night. Vicky kaushal's acting performance, It was one of the finest acting performances I've seen in recent times, You should maybe watch it fully for more details and then judge sweety 😀"
"Sam bahadur is just propaganda movie, atleast animal doesn't claim anything"

Nahh we haven’t. Talk for yourself lol 😂 Animal is a movie for theatre experience while SamBahadur can be watched in OTT also because the main thing is to know his story
Sam bahadur gatiya movie hai   Facts ko tod maroor ker dikhaya gaya h
"💯. Maine dono movie hi nahi dekhi abhi tak for exams,  agar koi movie jaaunga toh wo sabse pehle ""Sam Bahadur"" jaaunga agar after 17th laga hua hoga halls mein toh."
"Animal had fantastic film making went into it.  It knocked it out of the park in Direction, Screenplay, Editing, DI, Background Score, Music & Performances!!   Sam Bahadur? Vanilla movie with good intentions?"
"Field Marshal SAM Manekshaw's grit and gallantry across Burma in 1940 and liberation of Bangladesh..Gulzar Movie potrays Sam Bahadur in blood & spirits and covers ""War & Peace""..Its short of Hindi masala movies & competing with ""Animal"" is unfair..Toll free for all to watch.."
Pov:- you won't become an animal by watching #AnimalTheMovie and won't become sam manekshaw by watching #SamBahadur. Watch them both and enjoy whichever movie you like.😶
"Hey,  Sam Bahadur movie is made to wipe off wrong doings of indira & congress.   Indira humiliated Manekshaw and punished him for not follow his orders.   Manekshaw didn't receive salary and his dues until 2007 when Kalam went to him with his due amounting to more than 1 crore."
Massy Vs Classy. We don't deserve to have such class movie. People are busy with debating over #Animal . A few are talking about #Sambahadur. Why would the producer will invest if they can not recover the making cost. @vickykaushal09 #Vickykaishal
So you think only a movie is one way of knowing? People read books too for this!  Comparing two different genres and then saying 'WE' failed is flawed logic!  And for sure ott of sam bahadur will get more views than animal ! Animal is cinematic experience !
I watched #sambahadur over weekend.  It is failing not only because masala vs content but also due to how it was made. The story goes very fast and try to cover everything about Sir Maneksaw . Someone who don’t know about him may not understand it.  Movie lacks focus on storyline
"Jus like you need some spice in the food unfortunately Sam bahadur lacks that,it's a good movie but not like Raazi, the movie was more of documentary feeling ....Entertainment value was missing in Sam bahadur...."
It might have won the clash but overall it would have lost. Gadar2 also had good audience reception and same target audience so both movies would have made almost equal amount  Here it's going almost like a solo release. Sam Bahadur has some impact but it's not  as much as Gadar2
😮‍💨 misogynist movie h bhai. Sam bahadur ko blockbuster banayege hum.
"'SAM BAHADUR' is a decent movie. A biopic on the most celebrated Ex CoAS & India's first field marshal, a lengthy task which ended up segmented in a small discontinuous portrayal of events of the person's life & career. Vicky shines through. Fathima Sana as Indira is dud. 🥴 1/2"
I found Sam bahadur better movie than animal
You can criticize animal if you didn't like it but Sam Bahadur was a totally boring movie with no significant twists/turns or goosebump moments. Not even a single proper moment in the movie where your chest would swell with national pride.
According to some reviews Sam Bahadur is a propaganda movie hiding the role of some political figures in blunders & scams they caused and white washing or completely ignoring their deeds.
"Bhai sachi bata rha hu tujhe filmo se durr rahna chahiye. You didn't get Sam bahadur earlier and now Animal. Both are great movie and deserve success on BO. Animal has everything. There are some unwanted or scary scenes but the name of the Movie is ""Animal"". And it's an A rated"
"Rubbish movie, Sam Bahadur is much better than this junk"
Go for #Sambahadur. Movie with totally nationalist mindset... Amazing narration with up to the mark portrayal of Legendary character of Shri Sam Manekshaw..👏👏
"Honestly, good decision. Idk about animal, kyunki Maine dekhi hi nahi hai, so I can't judge it without seeing, but I did see Sam Bahadur yesterday, and it's a fab movie. 👍🏼"
"Should've released Sam Bahadur on different date, knowing Indians nowadays like masala more. I really liked Animal movie, shame Sam Bahadur wasn't released in my locale. However, poor tactic by Sam Bahadur's team, if it fails."
"Also Sam Bahadur is a pretty avg movie. With so much of content in hands, Megnna Gulzar could Have made a classic but she made just a decent avg movie but Vicky Kaushal though was awsome"
